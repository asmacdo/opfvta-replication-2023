\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Strengths of the original article as a reexecution target}
% this should be the shortest
The original paper made a significant effort to encapsulate all
components of the analysis as code, including the generation of images
and the rendering of the final pdf. Once properly installed, the
replication required little knowledge of the implementation details.

\subsection{Challenges}

Installation was challenging primarily because the process of installing
software on Gentoo is very slow. Building the container image took
about five hours, which lead to a slow development cycle where mistakes
were expensive.

\subsection{Outlook}
%this should be the longest

- Automation of reference results 
- Separation of components for re-use
