The [opfvta-replication-2023 repository][base-repo] is a [Datalad

CITE]. In short, it has a nested structure, with [datalad
subdatasets][subdatasets] for each of the following:

[Opfvta code repository][opfvta] is the software used to perform the analysis end-to-end.
[Opfvta data][opfvta_bidsdata] is the data collected for the original
paper.
[Mouse Brain Templates][mouse-brain-templates] are used as reference
data by the [SAMRI][samri] tool.
