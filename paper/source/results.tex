\section{Reproduction}

We compare the difference between the Historical Manuscript Record — a product of the original executable article generation — and the Novel Workflow Reexecution.
Reproduction differences between the article versions can best be inspected at a glance by evaluating the page-wise PDF difference (\ref{fig:diff_pages}).
This overview shows a consistent minimum baseline of differences, around $10^{-4}$ (i.e. \SI{0.01}{\percent}), best seen in pages 6 to 9.
When examined closely (\ref{fig:diff_date}), this difference corresponds to the modified date of the Historical Manuscript Record (2022-07-25) and the Novel Workflow Reexecution (2023-..).
While otherwise inconsequential, this difference provides a good litmus test for whether the article was indeed reexecuted or simply preserved, and should be expected throughout all comparisons.

Overall, inspecting the differences reveals a strong coherence at the qualitative but not at the quantitative level.
This coherence manifests in the statements from the original article remaining valid with regard to statistical summaries which emerge from  \textit{de novo} data processing (as seen in \ref{fig:diff_text}, \ref{fig:diff_fig}).
Quantitative incoherence is in the form of numerical variability of automatically generated metrics in the article text (\ref{fig:diff_text}), variability of sample distributions (\ref{fig:diff_fig}), as well as expected and predictable metadata changes (\ref{fig:diff_date}).

\subsection{Repository Structure}
%TODO cite YODA with a DOI? It's covered in the handbook but apparently no DOI or ISBN... If not we can make a results section on yoda here and become the DOI source.
In order to improve the reexecution reliability of the OPVFTA article we have constructed a parent repository encompassing the original article (including updates resulting as part of this study), the raw data it operates on, as well as container image and container execution instructions.
This layout type is known as YODA (a recursive acronym for “YODAs Organigram on Data Analysis”) and aims to facilitate reproducible research and good provenance tracking practices.

\end{figure}
%TODO: add colors to showcase what's actually a git submodule from somewhere else.

Notably, this repository structure diverges from the original reference article in directly linking the data at the repository level, as opposed to relying on its installation via the package manager.
Within the context of container usage, this affords the advantage of keeping the data packages separate and not adding their disk space requirements to those of the container image.

In this novel repository structure, external components of the reexecution study are managed as Git submodules, with data sumbodules being handled by git-annex, a versioning technology suitable for binary files, and made accessible via DataLad.
Notably, the article source code itself is not duplicated or furhter edited here, but handled as a Git submodule itself, with all proposed improvements being recorded in the original upstream repostitory.

%TODO: Something *descriptive* about how this new layout allows for more of a plug-in structure.

\subsection{Resource Refinement}

As a notable step in our automated full article reproduction effort, we have updated resources previously only available as tarballs (i.e. compressed \texttt{tar} archives), to DataLad.
This refinement permits both easier integration with the parent article reproduction repository for version tracking purposes.
In particular, our work encompassed the re-write of the Mouse Brain Templates package \cite{mbt05}  `Make` system.
In its new release \cite{mbt10}, developed as part of this study, Mouse Brain Templates now publishes tarballs, as well as DataLad-accessible unarchived individual template files.
