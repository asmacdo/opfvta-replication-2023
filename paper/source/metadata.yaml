abstract: "Three years have passed since ReScience published its first article
           and since September 2015, things have been going steadily. We're
           still alive, independent and without a budget. In the meantime, we
           have published around 20 articles (mostly in computational
           neuroscience & computational ecology) and the initial has grown
           from around 10 to roughly 100 members (editors and reviewers), we
           have advertised ReScience at several conferences worldwide, gave
           some interviews and we published an article introducing ReScience in
           PeerJ. Based on our experience at managing the journal during these
           three years, we think the time is ripe for proposing some changes."
