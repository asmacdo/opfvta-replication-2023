\section{Methods}
% Minutia regarding the infrastructure and resources, versions, where did we run this on, etc.
% Specific usage of the technologies referenced in general terms in Results, e.g. results introduces state-receall via Gentoo, here we say that's `git checkout` and give the hash.
% Specific commands prob go here.
% Describe the containerfile
% pip freeze

yoh: this could be the section to mention approaches tried but which
were not taken to lead to what is presented in the results.

that is where to mention/refer to

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

No new data was recorded, we have reused the data collected for [the
original paper][horea-paper].

TODO(Brief summary of data collection methods in original paper)
yoh: I would not bother -- just refer to original paper

TODO(How the data was stored and how we got it)
yoh: exactly -- let's describe how we acquired'' data from original
resources: tarballs etc, placed into datalad datasets.  refer where
possible to the handbook.

\subsection{Computing Environments}

\subsection{YODA}

yoh: to bind it all up

\subsection{Provenance}

datalad run/containers-run

\subsection{Paper figure reproducibility aspects}

pointers to the Horea's setups etc. How used here... containers for
the paper etc, github etc
