The study of ascending dopaminergic Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) projections in mice is crucial to translational research investigating human motivation, learning, and addiction. 
A prior article produced the first whole-brain opto-fMRI map of VTA-originating dopamenergic activation in mice, which constitutes a key reference map.
Further, the authors argue that the article has significant value as an example implementation of a deep brain stumilation analysis workflow, and that the article is written with full reproducibility in mind.
Herein, we share the results of an effort to reexecute, further standardize, and preserve their workflow, and compre the reexecution results to ascertain analyis reproducibility.
By leveraging container technology and related best practices, we have improved the portability, provenance tracking, and ease of reexecution of the workflow. 
We further ascertain the reproducibility of the original findings, in light of common non-deterministic data processing steps.
Lastly, we update the instruction set to minimize non-deterministic behaviour, and therefore provide an even more reliable reference workflow suitable for derivation and reuse.
