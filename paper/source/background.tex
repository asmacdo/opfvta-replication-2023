\section{Background}
% Things which should be skippable for anybody familiar with the field.
% Basically just a review of the technologies we build on and extend.
% Long commentary on methods actually goes here.
% Explain stuff like Gentoo or containers here.

\subsection{Prior Work}

The substrate of this

\subsubsection{Data Processing}

Data conversion from the proprietary ParaVision format was performed via the Bruker-to-BIDS repositing pipeline \supercite{aowsis} of the SAMRI package (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.4}} \supercite{samri}).
Following conversion, data was dummy-scan corrected, registered, and subject to controlled smoothing via the SAMRI Generic registration workflow \supercite{irsabi}.
As part of this processing, the first 10 volumes were discarded (automatically accounting for volumes excluded by the scanner software).
Registration was performed using the standard SAMRI mouse-brain-optimized parameter set for ANTs \supercite{ants} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{2.3.1}}).
Data was transformed to a stereotactically oriented standard space (the DSURQEC template space, as distributed in the Mouse Brain Atlases Package \supercite{atlases_generator}, version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.5.3}}), which is based on a high-resolution $\mathrm{T_2}$-weighted atlas \supercite{dsu1}.
Controlled spatial smoothing was applied in the coronal plane up to \SI{250}{\micro\meter} via the AFNI package \supercite{afni} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{19.1.05}}).

In our replication, we have used a more recent release of the SAMRI package [version 0.5.4][samri]. We have fixed several issues that allowed us to upgrade of some dependencies, including `numpy` and `pandas`, and [now works with datalad datasets][dotfilefilter].


\subsectio{Package Management}

The original analysis was performed on a [Gentoo linux][gentoo] system,
which builds and installs packages from source code. However, due to the 
Gentoo philosophy of rolling releases, it is difficult to ensure that
the software and all dependencies will correctly install in the future.
To address this problem, we have chosen to package the entire analysis
apparatus as an [OCI container image][oci]. This has the benefit of
preserving the work done as a part of this re-analysis, which can be
re-run without any knowledge of Gentoo, Python packaging, or the inner
workings of the code.
