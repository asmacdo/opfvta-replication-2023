The value of experimental research articles is inextricably contingent on data analysis results, which substantiate their natural language claims.
Data analysis procedures are highly and increasingly complex, their codification constitutes a cornerstone element of scientific work.
However, their intricacy and high reliance on extrinsic tools makes these analysis processes potentially fragile.
Thus it is of crucial importance for all constituent instructions to be not only recorded and accessible, but also formatted in such a way as to support robust reexecution.
Here, we examine a neuroimaging study which already publishes automated data analysis instructions, and detail the most prominent difficulties, in de novo article generation.
Further, we propose an emerging reference reexecution standard which leverages explicit dependency management as well as container technologies, in order to improve portability, provenance tracking, and ease of deployment.
Lastly, we ascertain the reproduction accuracy within the new environment in light of common non-deterministic steps in data processing, and discuss how to reduce the most widespread instances of non-deterministic behaviour.
